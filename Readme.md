Penzle represent client library that makes it simple to communicate with the Penzle RESTFull API. It was developed with
the intention of targeting versions of the .NET Framework that are greater than or equal to 4.6, as well as versions of
DotNet Core and .NET Standard. Simply going to the [website](https://www.penzle.com) for Penzle Tech Stack will allow
you to acquire further knowledge regarding the product.

## **Getting started**

Installation of the core penzle package without support for dependency injection using the Visual Studio Package Manager
Console:

```
Install-Package Penzle.Net
```

Installation using .NET CLI:

```
dotnet add <your project> package Penzle.Net
```

Installation of the penzle package with support for dependency injection using the Visual Studio Package Manager
Console:

```
Install-Package Penzle.Net.Microsoft.DependencyInjection
```

Installation using .NET CLI:

```
dotnet add <your project> package Penzle.Net.Microsoft.DependencyInjection
```

## **Recommended & minimum configuration example**

Create a strong type model that is compatible with your data template first before you do anything else.

```csharp
public sealed class Author
{
    public string? Summary { get; set; }
}
```

```csharp
public sealed class Address
{
    public string? Street { get; set; }
    public string? City { get; set; }
    public string? State { get; set; }
    public string? Zip { get; set; }
}
```

Our secure architecture served as the foundation for the creation of clients for delivery and management. The key must be different for delivery and managament client. Otherwise, the system will return a forbidden response. Please click the following [link](https://docs.penzle.com/api/authentication-and-authorization/index.html) to learn more about it.

To retrieve data from the Penzle API, you must make a call using the `IDeliveryPenzleClient`.

If you're using our package for IoC, you need to set it up the way recommended in the documentation. If not, you can use the static method `Factory`, which can be accessed through `DeliveryPenzleClient` and has multiple overloads. There is an example of how to set up the minimum configuration.

```csharp

// You should use this url from configuration for actual world usage, such as production, or even just for best practices.
const string DefaultUrl = "https://api-{your-tenant-name}.penzle.com";
var apiAddress = new Uri(uriString: DefaultUrl, uriKind: UriKind.Absolute);

// You should use this key from a secure configuration, such as Azure Key Vault, following the best security practice.
const string ApiKey = "<your-key" > ;

// Use the Factory method to create a new instance of the Penzle API client, giving the API address and API key.
var deliveryPenzleClient = DeliveryPenzleClient.Factory(baseAddress: apiAddress, apiDeliveryKey: ApiKey, apiOptions: options =>
{
	options.Project = "default"; // Define the project name which you want to use.
	options.Environment = "main"; // Define the environment name which you want to use for the project.
});

// Using query builder to define request parameters.
var query = QueryEntryBuilder.Instance
            .WithParentId(parentId: new Guid(g: "2e2c2146-15b1-41ed-9bca-b77e346f8f0a"))
            .WithPagination(pagination:QueryPaginationBuilder.Default
                            .WithPage(page: 1)
                            .WithPageSize(pageSize: 10));

try
{

    // You can call the API methods for fetching the entry data with pagination using an instance of the Penzle API client that you have created.
	var entries = await deliveryPenzleClient.Entry.GetPaginationListEntries<Entry<Author>>(query: query);

    // Print the total number of entries.
	Console.WriteLine(value: $"Total count of entries: {entries.TotalCount}");

    // Print the entries to the console.
	foreach (var entry in entries.Items)
	{
		// Print the entry system fields.
		Console.WriteLine(value: $"Entry {entry.System.Name} system fields:");
		Console.WriteLine(value: $"System Id: {entry.System.Id}");
		Console.WriteLine(value: $"System Template: {entry.System.Template}");
		Console.WriteLine(value: $"System Language: {entry.System.Language}");
		Console.WriteLine(value: $"System Version: {entry.System.Version}");
		Console.WriteLine(value: $"System CreatedAt: {entry.System.CreatedAt}");
		Console.WriteLine(value: $"System ModifiedAt: {entry.System.ModifiedAt}");

        // Print the entry fields.
		Console.WriteLine(value: $"Entry {entry.System.Name} fields:");
		Console.WriteLine(value: $"Summary: {entry.Fields.Summary}");

        // Print the entry base collection fields.
		foreach (var @base in entry.Base)
		{
			Console.WriteLine(value: "Entry base fields:");
			Console.WriteLine(value: $"Fields dictionary: {@base.Fields}");
		}

		// Get strong type base object.
		var address = entries.Items.First().Base.BaseEntityTo<Address>();

        // Print base address object
		Console.WriteLine(value: address.City);
		Console.WriteLine(value: address.State);
		Console.WriteLine(value: address.Zip);
		Console.WriteLine(value: address.Street);
	}
}
catch (PenzleException exception) // Handle exceptions.
{
	Console.WriteLine(value: exception);
	throw;
}
```

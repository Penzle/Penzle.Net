**Penzle.Net** & **Penzle.Net.Microsoft.DependencyInjection** is a client library that provides an easy method to
communicate with the Penzle RESTFull API. It is designed to target versions of the.NET Framework that are greater than
or equal to 4.6, DotNet Core, and.NET Standard that are greater than or equal to 2.1. You can discover additional
information about Penzle Tech Stack by visiting the [website](https://www.penzle.com).

## **Getting started**

Installation of the core penzle package without support for dependency injection using the Visual Studio Package Manager
Console:

```
Install-Package Penzle.Net
```

Installation using .NET CLI:

```
dotnet add <your project> package Penzle.Net
```

Installation of the penzle package with support for dependency injection using the Visual Studio Package Manager
Console:

```
Install-Package Penzle.Net.Microsoft.DependencyInjection
```

Installation using .NET CLI:

```
dotnet add <your project> package Penzle.Net.Microsoft.DependencyInjection
```

## **Simple usage example**

To begin, create a DTO model that is compatible with your data template.

```csharp
public class Student
{
    public DateTime DateOfBirth { get; set; }
    public decimal NumberOfIndex { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public EntrySystem System { get; set; }
    public List<BaseTemplates> Base { get; set; };
}
```

If you want to retrieve data from the Penzle API, all you have to do is make a call using the `IPenzleClient`:

```csharp
var student = await penzleClient
                .Entry
                .GetEntry<Student>
                (
                     entryId: new Guid(g: "b30f6a28-e8b9-4886-ac28-0109aaf959af"),
                     cancellationToken: CancellationToken.None
                );
                     
Console.WriteLine(student.Title);
Console.WriteLine(student.DateOfBirth);
```
